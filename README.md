# CreativeBlogsApp
This is a repo for my blog website that i will be developing as practice to learn more about ASP Net Core blazor server and coupled with a NoSQL database (MongoDB). This project will take inspiration from the "Building a Suggestion Site App" series by the Youtube Channel IAmTimCorey so you might see a lot of similar code to that project.
